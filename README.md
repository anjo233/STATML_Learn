# Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy: Tutorial Repository

This repository contains companion tutorials for the textbook **[Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12230)** by Yuan-Sen Ting.

## Overview

These tutorials provide hands-on, practical implementations of the concepts covered in the textbook. Each tutorial is designed as a standalone Jupyter notebook that explores key statistical and machine learning concepts through real astronomical applications.

## Tutorial Status

We are currently in the process of cleaning up and standardizing all tutorials from the textbook. The tutorials listed below have been fully revised and are ready for use. Additional tutorials will be added as they are completed.

## Prerequisites

To run these tutorials, you'll need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Usage

Each tutorial is self-contained and includes:
- Theoretical background connecting to the textbook chapters
- Step-by-step code implementations
- Visualizations and interpretations
- Exercises for further exploration

The tutorials are designed to be worked through sequentially within each notebook, but can be adapted for classroom use or self-study.

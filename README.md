# Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy: Tutorial Repository

This repository contains companion tutorials for the textbook **[Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12230)** by Yuan-Sen Ting.

## Overview

These tutorials provide hands-on, practical implementations of the concepts covered in the textbook. Each tutorial is designed as a standalone Jupyter notebook that explores key statistical and machine learning concepts through real astronomical applications.

## Tutorials

### Chapter 2: Bayesian Inference
- **File**: `tutorial_chapter2.ipynb`
- **Topics**: Probability distributions, Poisson processes, maximum likelihood estimation, spatial statistics
- **Application**: Detecting stellar clusters through statistical analysis of spatial point patterns

### Chapter 3: Statistical Foundations and Summary Statistics
- **File**: `tutorial_chapter3.ipynb`
- **Topics**: Statistical moments, correlation functions, bootstrap methods, two-point statistics
- **Application**: Detecting the BAO signal in simulated cosmological data

### Chapter 7: Classification and Logistic Regression
- **File**: `tutorial_chapter7.ipynb`
- **Topics**: Logistic regression, sigmoid transformation, gradient descent optimization, classification metrics, hyperparameter tuning
- **Application**: Distinguishing Red Clump from Red Giant Branch stars using stellar parameters from APOGEE

## Prerequisites

To run these tutorials, you'll need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Usage

Each tutorial is self-contained and includes:
- Theoretical background connecting to the textbook chapters
- Step-by-step code implementations
- Visualizations and interpretations
- Exercises for further exploration

The tutorials are designed to be worked through sequentially within each notebook, but can be adapted for classroom use or self-study.
